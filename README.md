# VASPtoExcelSheet
Sometimes, as a result of huge amount of data it becomes really inefficient to transfer the VASP calculation results from notebook to excel manually. Therefore, I wrote a script to transform all the results from the calculation folders to excel sheet. It also sorts the values of energies from the highest to the lowest.
